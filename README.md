# Welcome_to_INITECH
INITECH has encoutered legal "issues" with Microsoft and is transitioning to a Linux Enviroment.
They need your Help.
Now you can become INITECH's SYS Admin and create employee user accounts.
Peter Gibbons, Milton Waddams, Michael Bolton and the rest of the gang are on board.
But maybe you can put a bug in Lumberg's account and claim it's a "glitch in the system" and 
That he needs to "see payroll about that." 
Are you up to the challenge??
